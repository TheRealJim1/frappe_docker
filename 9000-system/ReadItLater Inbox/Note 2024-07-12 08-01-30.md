[opus] world_sim> i need you to generate the code next or setup a detailed export for me to use with other llms

Understood! Given the complexity of the project, it would be challenging to generate the entire codebase in this conversation. However, I can provide you with a detailed project specification that you can use to guide the development process, either on your own or in collaboration with other AI assistants. This spec can serve as a blueprint for the project and help ensure that all the necessary components are included.

Here's a detailed project specification for the AI Society Simulator:

This spec provides a high-level overview of the project structure, components, dependencies, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. It can be used as a starting point for the development process and can be shared with other AI assistants or human collaborators to help them understand the project's scope and requirements.

To begin the development process, you can:

1. Create a new GitHub repository for the project and initialize it with the specified folder structure.

2. Implement the core simulator components (World, Entities, Jobs, Policies) based on the descriptions provided.

3. Integrate O*NET data into the simulator using the specified DataLoader, JobMapper, and SkillAnalyzer modules.

4. Create sample experiment scripts and Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate the simulator's functionality.

5. Write unit tests for the simulator components to ensure their correctness and maintainability.

6. Document the project's vision, architecture, and policy ideas in the docs/ folder.

7. Publish the project on GitHub and invite collaborators to contribute.

Remember, this is just a starting point, and the project can evolve based on your needs and insights. Feel free to modify the specification as needed and iterate on the design as you progress.
