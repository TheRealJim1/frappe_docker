Here's a brief explanation of the main components:

- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, its goals, and how to get started.
- `LICENSE`: Specifies the open-source license for the project.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation files explaining the project's vision, technical architecture, and policy ideas to explore.
- `simulator/`: Contains the main simulator codebase.
- `world.py`: Defines the core simulation environment.
- `entities/`: Defines classes for various entities in the simulated world (people, organizations, AI systems).
- `jobs/`: Defines classes for different job types, including emerging roles.
- `policies/`: Defines classes representing different policy interventions.
- `utils/`: Contains utility modules for data generation and visualization.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for different components of the simulator.
- `experiments/`: Contains scripts for running specific simulation experiments.
- `data/`: Stores data files used to initialize and calibrate the simulation.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.
- `config.yaml`: Specifies configuration settings for the simulator.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python dependencies for the project.

To get started, contributors can clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, install the required dependencies, and begin exploring the codebase. They can define new entity types, job classes, and policy interventions, and run experiments to test different scenarios.

The project can evolve collaboratively over time, with contributors adding new features, improving the simulator's fidelity, and sharing insights from their experiments. The ultimate goal is to use the platform to explore strategies for steering the development of AI and digital technologies in a direction that maximizes human flourishing.

Let me know if you have any other questions! I'm excited to see where this project could go.
[opus] world_sim> i want O*NET data sources included 


Great idea! Integrating O*NET data into the project could provide valuable insights into the current job market and help inform the design of new job types and economic policies. Here's an updated project structure that includes O*NET data:

```
ai-society-simulator/
├── ...
├── data/
│   ├── initial_conditions.json
│   ├── job_market_data.csv
│   ├── onet/
│   │   ├── occupation_data.csv
│   │   ├── skills_data.csv
│   │   ├── tasks_data.csv
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
├── ...
└── onet_integration/
├── __init__.py
├── data_loader.py
├── job_mapper.py
└── skill_analyzer.py
```

The main changes:

1. Addition of an `onet/` subdirectory in the `data/` folder to store O*NET datasets:
- `occupation_data.csv`: Contains information about different occupations, such as job titles, descriptions, and employment numbers.
- `skills_data.csv`: Contains data about the skills required for various occupations.
- `tasks_data.csv`: Contains data about the tasks performed in different occupations.
- Other relevant O*NET data files can be added as needed.

2. Creation of an `onet_integration/` module to handle the integration of O*NET data into the simulator:
- `data_loader.py`: Responsible for loading and preprocessing O*NET data from the CSV files.
- `job_mapper.py`: Maps existing occupations to the new job types defined in the simulator, based on skill and task similarities.
- `skill_analyzer.py`: Analyzes the skills required for different occupations and helps identify skill gaps and training needs.

To leverage the O*NET data in the simulator:

1. Download the relevant O*NET datasets and place them in the `data/onet/` directory.

2. Update the simulator's initialization process to load the O*NET data using the `data_loader.py` module.

3. Use the `job_mapper.py` module to map O*NET occupations to the new job types defined in the simulator. This can help estimate the potential demand for these new roles based on existing job market data.

4. Utilize the `skill_analyzer.py` module to identify the skills required for the new job types and compare them to the skills of the current workforce. This can inform policies around education, training, and reskilling programs.

5. Incorporate the O*NET data into the simulator's models and experiments to better understand the potential impacts of AI and digital technologies on the job market and to design policies that promote a smooth transition to the new economy.

By integrating O*NET data, the project can ground its simulations in real-world job market dynamics and provide more actionable insights for policymakers, educators, and other stakeholders.
